## Description

For this challenge created the Javascript code for a random password generator.

## Solutions/Notes

- I started with defining my variables for the characters I would be using for the password generator, and created them as strings and used the split to make an array.
- I then created my if statements for pasword length and had it pop up as an alert. With what they would need to do in order to move forward.
- I created variables for the character requerments, and made and if statement saying your password must contain certain characters.
- From there I created a for statement that would randomize the password using arrays that would pull from the characters. I did this for each neccessary character.
-Lastly I had it return the randomized password.
